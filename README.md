# beets-moreinfo-plugin
Plugin to pull metadata breakdown of beets database

This is a small plugin I wrote for the beets autotagger to give me interesting information about my offline music collection.
It adds a new command to the beets program, "moreinfo" and works just by querying the beets metadata SQL database.

Example usage:
